# (slib wt-tree)

This is a port of the weight-balanced tree library used by
MIT Scheme to CHICKEN 5 Scheme.

## Author

The R4RS version of this library is the work of Stephen Adams and
was, I think, adapted from the MIT Scheme version, also by Adams.
Peter Lane made some R7RS adaptions in 2017.

This version of the library was adapted for CHICKEN by
Wolfgang Corcoran-Mathe.
